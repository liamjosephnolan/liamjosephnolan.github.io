## About Me

I am an American Engineer living in Austria where I am pursuing a Master's Degree in Mechatronics. 
I have over four years of industry experience in Medical Devices and Robotics having worked as a 
Mechanical Design Engineer on a surgical robotics system at Ethicon. I am also well versed in software 
and robotic control having worked extensively with Python, ROS2, Linux, and MATLAB during my Master's 
degree. I built this website to showcase my professional experience and personal projects. I am 
passionate about the design and control of complex robotic systems, sustainable solutions for our 
future, and medical devices. I am currently looking for internship opportunities or Master's thesis
topics in the field of robotics, sustainable energy, medical devices, or control engineering.
