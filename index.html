								  <h3>Cover Letter</h3>
								  <p>To Whom It May Concern,
									
									<p>I am writing to express my sincere interest in pursuing 
									an internship opportunity within your organization.
									As a dedicated Mechatronics Engineer with substantial
									industry experience, I am eager to contribute my
									skills and enthusiasm for robotic control and mechanical 
									design to your team.
									</p>

									<p>
									During my role as a Mechanical Engineer at Ethicon from July 
									2019 to March 2023, I served as the Project Lead for a crucial
										 mechanical immobilization solution for surgeon consoles. 
										 This experience allowed me to demonstrate my leadership 
										 capabilities and in-depth knowledge of mechanical design
										 and robotic principles. Additionally, I took on the
										  responsibility of leading a team for a capital equipment
										   packaging project, where I coordinated the design, 
										   manufacturing, and testing of the packaging for our
											laparoscopic surgical solution. My involvement 
											extended to the coordination of manufacturing processes 
											for various PCB and optical test fixtures, showcasing my
											 proficiency in both design and manufacturing aspects of 
											 mechatronics. Furthermore, I actively supported procedure
											 development efforts in surgical labs, contributing to the
											  enhancement of surgical robotic systems.
									</p>
									
									
									​
									<p>
									In an effort to further my knowledge in robotic design and control, I decided to go back to school to pursue a Master’s degree at MCI in Innsbruck, Austria.
									</p>
																			​
									<p>
									My involvement in various projects, such as FIRST Robotics, PolySAT, and Battlebots, along with my technical skills encompassing mechanical design, manufacturing, and software proficiency, further highlight my commitment to the field of mechatronics.
									</p>
									​
									<p>
									I am confident that my hands-on industry experience, coupled with my comprehensive technical skills and strong educational background, positions me as an ideal candidate for an internship within your organization. I am particularly drawn to your company's commitment to innovation, and I am excited about the prospect of contributing to your team.
									</p>
									​
									<P>
									Thank you for considering my application. I am eager to discuss how my skills and experiences align with the goals of your organization and contribute to the advancement of your cutting-edge projects.
								</P>
									​
									<p>Sincerely,</p>
									<p>Liam Nolan</p>
