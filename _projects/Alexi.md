Alexi was a 3lb combat robot I designed, manufactured, and tested. 
I was the sole engineer on this project and while this project was 
just for fun in my spare time I learned a great deal about advanced 
manufacturing techniques, and electronic component selection. The entire robot
was modeled in Solidworks and machined on an Fanuc 3 Axis CNC mill. Design features
include a Unibody 6061 Chasis, interchangable frontal weapon, invertable design and
custom drum spinner powered by a brushless motor.
