This simple Python script was created to display the weather of a choosen city in a Linux terminal. It utilizes the request library to fetch data from the OpenWeatherMap API and then displays the data using the PrettyTable Library. A helpful frog also gives other fun information! The .bashrc file was also modified to be able call it from any directory.
