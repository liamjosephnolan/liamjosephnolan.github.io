  about:             |
    I am an American Engineer living in Austria where I am pursuing a Master's 
    Degree in Mechatronics. I have over four years of industry experience in 
    Medical Devices and Robotics having worked as a Mechanical Design Engineer 
    on a surgical robotics system at Ethicon. I am also well versed in software 
    and robotic control having worked extensively with Python, ROS2, Linux, and 
    MATLAB during my Master's degree. I built this website to showcase my 
    professional experience and personal projects. I am passionate about the 
    design and control of complex robotic systems, sustainable solutions for 
    our future, and medical devices. I am currently looking for internship 
    opportunities or Master's thesis topics in the field of robotics, sustainable
     energy, medical devices, or control engineering.
